Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has dominated the discussion around making GenAI applications useful since ChatGPT’s advent exploded the AI hype

In recent evaluations, GraphRAG demonstrated its ability to answer “global questions” that address the entire dataset, a task where naive RAG approaches often fail.

"We need an alternative retrieval method that allows us to answer these 'Global', aggregative questions in addition to the 'Local' extractive questions". Welcome to Graph RAG!
